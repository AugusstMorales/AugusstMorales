# Hello, my name is August

I am passionate about technology and self-learning methodologies. I specialize in developing efficient and functional backend solutions, always striving to enhance my skills and add value to every project.

On this platform, [**@GitHub**](https://github.com), you will find projects built with Python, Go, and Next.js, along with various automation scripts designed for **Linux** and **Mac** systems.
